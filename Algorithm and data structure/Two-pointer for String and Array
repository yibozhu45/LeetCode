#Two pointer doesn't mean the data type is pointer. It means  using the idea of pointer

In the previous chapter, we solve some problems by iterating the array. 
Typically, we only use one pointer starting from the first element and ending at the last one to do iteration. 
However, sometimes, we might need to use two pointers at the same time to do the iteration.

Eg: Reverse the elements in an array.
void reverse(int *v, int N) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = N - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        swap(v[i], v[j]);
        i++;
        j--;
    }
}
