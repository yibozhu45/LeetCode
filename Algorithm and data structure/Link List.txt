Always examine if the node is null before you call the next field.

Carefully define the end conditions of your loop.

1. decide cur != NULL or cur -> next != NULL
2. if it is a empty linked list
3. Initialize ListNode* pointer

The linked list is a linear data structure. Each element in the linked list is actually a separate object while all the objects are linked together by the reference field in each element.

Each node in a singly-linked list contains not only the value but also a reference field to link to the next node. By this way, the singly-linked list organizes all the nodes in a sequence.

In most cases, we will use the head node (the first node) to represent the whole list.

Unlike the array, we are not able to access a random element in a singly-linked list in constant time. If we want to get the ith element, we have to traverse from the head node one by one. It takes us O(N) time on average to visit an element by index, where N is the length of the linked list.

Insert a new node into a linked list in O(1) time complexity, which is very efficient.

The time complexity of deleting a node will be O(N). The space complexity is O(1) because we only need constant space to store our pointers.

Design Single Linked List
// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct SinglyListNode {
    int val;
    SinglyListNode *next;
    SinglyListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

1. Initiate a new linked list: represent a linked list using the head node.
class MyLinkedList {
private:
    SinglyListNode *head;
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MyLinkedList() {
        head = NULL;
    }
};

2. Traverse the linked list to get element by index.
/** Helper function to return the index-th node in the linked list. */
SinglyListNode* getNode(int index) {
    SinglyListNode *cur = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < index && cur; ++i) {
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    return cur;
}
/** Helper function to return the last node in the linked list. */
SinglyListNode* getTail() {
    SinglyListNode *cur = head;
    while (cur && cur->next) {
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    return cur;
}
/** Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1. */
int get(int index) {
    SinglyListNode *cur = getNode(index);
    return cur == NULL ? -1 : cur->val;
}

3. Add a new node.

/** Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list. */
void addAtHead(int val) {
    SinglyListNode *cur = new SinglyListNode(val);
    cur->next = head;
    head = cur;
    return;
}

/** Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list. */
void addAtTail(int val) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        addAtHead(val);
        return;
    }
    SinglyListNode *prev = getTail();
    SinglyListNode *cur = new SinglyListNode(val);
    prev->next = cur;
}

/** Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. If index equals to the length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted. */
void addAtIndex(int index, int val) {
    if (index == 0) {
        addAtHead(val);
        return;
    }
    SinglyListNode *prev = getNode(index - 1);
    if (prev == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    SinglyListNode *cur = new SinglyListNode(val);
    SinglyListNode *next = prev->next;
    cur->next = next;
    prev->next = cur;
}

5. Delete a node.

/** Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid. */
void deleteAtIndex(int index) {
    SinglyListNode *cur = getNode(index);
    if (cur == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    SinglyListNode *prev = getNode(index - 1);
    SinglyListNode *next = cur->next;
    if (prev) {
        prev->next = next;
    } else {
        // modify head when deleting the first node.
        head = next;
    }
}

Two pointer:

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

That's exactly what we will come across using two pointers with different speed in a linked list:

If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will stop at the end of the linked list.
If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet with the slow pointer.

It is a safe choice to move the slow pointer one step at a time while moving the fast pointer two steps at a time. For each iteration, the fast pointer will move one extra step. If the length of the cycle is M, after M iterations, the fast pointer will definitely move one more cycle and catch up with the slow pointer.

Double linked list

// Definition for doubly-linked list.
struct DoublyListNode {
    int val;
    DoublyListNode *next, *prev;
    DoublyListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL), prev(NULL) {}
};

1. Initiate a new linked list: represent a linked list using the head node.

class MyLinkedList {
private:
    DoublyListNode *head;
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MyLinkedList() {
        head = NULL;
    }
}

2. Traverse the linked list to get element by index.

/** Helper function to return the index-th node in the linked list. */
DoublyListNode* getNode(int index) {
    DoublyListNode *cur = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < index && cur; ++i) {
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    return cur;
}
/** Helper function to return the last node in the linked list. */
DoublyListNode* getTail() {
    DoublyListNode *cur = head;
    while (cur && cur->next) {
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    return cur;
}
/** Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1. */
int get(int index) {
    DoublyListNode *cur = getNode(index);
    return cur == NULL ? -1 : cur->val;
}
    
 3. Add a new node.

/** Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list. */
void addAtHead(int val) {
    DoublyListNode *cur = new DoublyListNode(val);
    cur->next = head;
    if (head) {
        head->prev = cur;
    }
    head = cur;
    return;
}

/** Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list. */
void addAtTail(int val) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        addAtHead(val);
        return;
    }
    DoublyListNode *prev = getTail();
    DoublyListNode *cur = new DoublyListNode(val);
    prev->next = cur;
    cur->prev = prev;
}

/** Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. If index equals to the length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted. */
void addAtIndex(int index, int val) {
    if (index == 0) {
        addAtHead(val);
        return;
    }
    DoublyListNode *prev = getNode(index - 1);
    if (prev == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    DoublyListNode *cur = new DoublyListNode(val);
    DoublyListNode *next = prev->next;
    cur->prev = prev;
    cur->next = next;
    prev->next = cur;
    if (next) {
        next->prev = cur;
    }
}

5. Delete a node.

/** Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid. */
void deleteAtIndex(int index) {
    DoublyListNode *cur = getNode(index);
    if (cur == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    DoublyListNode *prev = cur->prev;
    DoublyListNode *next = cur->next;
    if (prev) {
        prev->next = next;
    } else {
        // modify head when deleting the first node.
        head = next;
    }
    if (next) {
        next->prev = prev;
    }
}
............................................................................
Let's briefly review the performance of the singly linked list and doubly linked list.

They are similar in many operations:

Both of them are not able to access the data at a random position in constant time.
Both of them are able to add a new node after given node or at the beginning of the list in O(1) time.
Both of them are able to delete the first node in O(1) time.

But it is a little different to delete a given node (including the last node).
1. In a singly linked list, it is not able to get the previous node of a given node so we have to spend O(N) time to find out 2. the previous node before deleting the given node.
In a doubly linked list, it will be much easier because we can get the previous node with the "prev" reference field. So we can delete a given node in O(1) time.

If you need to add or delete a node frequently, a linked list could be a good choice.

If you need to access an element by index often, an array might be a better choice than a linked list.
