How recursive work in a tree:
1. when function() called, it will do until the base case.

2.jump back, do one level up the base case



When use node -> val, node -> right, node -> left, consider node != NULL first!
...............................
Tree:
Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has N nodes and N-1 edges.

Binary Tree:
A Binary Tree is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

Traversal:
Pre-order traversal:
Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

    vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> v;
        stack<TreeNode*> s;
        while(root != NULL || !s.empty())
        {
            if(root != NULL)
            {
                v.push_back(root -> val);
                s.push(root);
                root = root -> left;
            }
            else
            {
                root = s.top();
                s.pop();
                root = root -> right;  
            }
        }
            
        return v;
    }
};

In-order traversal:
In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.
Typically, for binary search tree, we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal.

            v.push_back(root -> val);//root
            helper(root -> right);//right
        }
    }
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root);
        return v;
    }
};

    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> v;
        stack<TreeNode*> s;
        while(root != NULL || !s.empty())
        {
            if(root != NULL)
            {
                s.push(root);
                root = root -> left;
            }
            else
            {
                root = s.top();
                s.pop();
                v.push_back(root -> val);
                root = root -> right;  
            }
        }
            
        return v;
    }
};
Post-order traversal:
Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.
It is worth noting that when you delete nodes in a tree, deletion process will be in post-order. That is to say, when you delete a node, you will delete its left child and its right child before you delete the node itself.

Also, post-order is widely use in mathematical expression. It is easier to write a program to parse a post-order expression.

            helper(root -> right);//right

        }

    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root);
        return v;
    }

        stack<TreeNode*> s1;
        
        s1.push(root);
        while(!s1.empty())
        {
            root = s1.top();
            s1.pop();
            
            if(root -> left != NULL)
            {
                s1.push(root -> left);
            }
            
            if(root -> right != NULL)
            {
                s1.push(root -> right);
            }
            v.push_back(root -> val);  
        }
        reverse(v.begin(), v.end());
        return v;
    }

1. Depth First Search (DFS)-recursive

In this strategy, we adopt the depth as the priority, so that one would start from a root and reach down to a leaf, and then back to root to reach another branch.

The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as preorder, inorder, and postorder depending on the relative order among the root node, left node, and right node.

2. Breadth First Search (BFS)-iterations with the queue

We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height, from top to bottom. The nodes on a higher level would be visited before the ones on the lower levels.
