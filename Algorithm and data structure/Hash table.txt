Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search.

There are two different kinds of hash tables: hash set and hash map.
  The hash set is one of the implementations of a set data structure to store no repeated values.
  The hash map is one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.
  
The Principle of Hash Table
  The key idea of Hash Table is to use a hash function to map keys to buckets.

When the problem needs two "for" loop to solve, we can use hash table. 

In C++, map will work.
For example: we can put vector value and index in a map as mp<value, index>

map find() only can be used to find key, can't be used to find value.
