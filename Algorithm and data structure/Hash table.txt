(Unordered_map: Internally unordered_map is implemented using Hash Table, the key provided to map are hashed into indices of hash table)

A hash table is a data structure which is used to store key-value pairs.

When the problem needs two "for" loop to solve, we can use hash table. 

In C++, map will work.
For example: we can put vector value and index in a map as mp<value, index>
